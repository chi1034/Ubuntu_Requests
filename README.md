# Ubuntu Image Fetcher 🖼️

*"I am because we are." – Ubuntu Philosophy*  

This is a simple Python project inspired by the Ubuntu spirit of **community, respect, sharing, and practicality**.  
The program fetches images from the internet, saves them into a local folder, and organizes them for later use.  


## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Fetch images from the web using `requests`  
- ✅ Creates a **Fetched_Images/** directory automatically  
- ✅ Extracts filename from URL or generates one if missing  
- ✅ Prevents duplicate downloads  
- ✅ Gracefully handles network errors  
- ✅ Supports multiple URLs at once  
- ✅ Supports both binary images (JPG/PNG) and SVG images
